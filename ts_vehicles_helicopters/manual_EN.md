# Vehicles: Helicopters

Helicopters can be used to transport players and goods quickly by air.

Compared to ground-based vehicles, the transport capacity is limited and the fuel usage is increased.

## Construction

First of all, you have to place a helicopter skid.
You can then add parts to your helicopter by right-clicking it with them.

If you try to enter the helicopter (by right-clicking it), a chat message will appear with information about what parts are still missing.

The helicopter's form can be opened with shift + right-click on the helicopter.

Many types of parts (e.g. hull, seats etc.) can be colored in the crafting grid.

For destruction, empty the storage rooms and the tank, remove all parts and then pick the helicopter skid up by left-clicking it.

## Control and Lights

You can enter and leave the helicopter by right-clicking it.

The engine and the lights can be controlled via the control panel.
Before you can start the engine, it is necessary to turn the navigation and anti-collision lights on.

Starting and stopping the engine takes 10 seconds each.

After usage, it is necessary to turn the engine off manually.
Simply exiting the helicopter doesn't suffice.

The direction can be controlled by the WASD keys.
For climbing, press space.
For sinking, press shift.

## Storage

By left-clicking the helicopter with an item, you can add it to the storage room quickly and easily.
The storage room can be accessed via the helicopter's form (use shift + right-click to open it).

## Fuel

Helicopters can use gasoline and hydrogen as power sources.

### Stations

Fuelling stations have to be connected to the respective network on the bottom side.
A pump is necessary.

For fuelling operations, the helicopter has to be placed in such way that there is no obstacle and a maximum distance of 3 meters between the station and the fuel tank cap (on the back side).
You can then connect the hose by opening the station's form and choosing the desired vehicle.

### Emergency fuelling

You can use gasoline canisters or barrels and hydrogen cylinders to refuel your helicopter if no station is available.

## Passengers

A helicopter can have one passenger in addition to the pilot.
Just enter the helicopter after the pilot.

You can choose if you want to open the helicopter for everyone as a passenger or if only owners should be allowed as passengers.
